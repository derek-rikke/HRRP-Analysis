# HRRP-Analysis
Portfolio project analyzing Hospital Readmission Reduction Program datasets to showcase python and tableau skills.

This project analyzes recent U.S. hospital quality using CMS’s Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), which reports 3-year rolling, risk-adjusted 30-day readmission ratios (ERR) for six conditions. Because HRRP ties results to Medicare penalties, the data is policy-relevant, standardized, and comparable across ~3,000 hospitals. We examine national/state trends and hospital outliers from FY2021–FY2025 (rolling windows), with methods and limitations clearly documented.


About the Data / Why HRRP
This project uses data from the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). HRRP measures hospital performance by tracking 30-day unplanned readmission rates for six conditions/procedures:

Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)

Heart Failure (HF)

Pneumonia (PN)

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)

Total Hip/Knee Arthroplasty (THA/TKA)

Hospitals with higher-than-expected readmissions can face financial penalties from CMS, making HRRP a critical metric for hospital systems nationwide.

Why HRRP is a strong choice for this project:

It is standardized and consistent across thousands of hospitals in the U.S.

It reflects real-world impact: hospitals change behavior to avoid penalties.

The data is recent, detailed, and publicly available, making it ideal for portfolio analysis.

Limitations to keep in mind:

HRRP only covers six conditions, not overall hospital performance.

Readmission rates can be influenced by community factors (e.g., poverty, outpatient access), not just hospital quality.

Safety-net hospitals often argue the metric penalizes them disproportionately.

Despite these limitations, HRRP is a widely recognized and policy-relevant measure of quality. For this project, it provides a strong foundation for analyzing trends in hospital performance over time and across geographies.
